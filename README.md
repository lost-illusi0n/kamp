### NOTICE: This library is still heavy in development and does not implement most of the Basic profile. I do not recommend anybody to use it in the current state as there are going to be breaking changes and further refactoring. Featured are implemented as needed by me, unless there is an interest in something specific. Documentation is scarce. Wait for a stable release :)
A type-safe, coroutine-friendly, implementation of the WAMP protocol that is built with Kotlin, for Kotlin.
